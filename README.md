# Welcome to My 100_DaysOfRTL!

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Meghana Ganesh, and I have a strong passion for digital design and RTL programming. This repository is focused on my 100-day RTL challenge, where I'll be documenting my journey and sharing RTL design projects using tools like Xilinx Vivado and ModelSim for simulations.

## About me...

I'm a passionate engineer and a VLSI aficionado with a keen interest in digital circuitry and hardware description languages (HDLs). As a learner, I have acquired hands-on experience in RTL programming using Verilog and have extensively utilized Xilinx Vivado.

My enthusiasm lies in the realm of VLSI design, and I thrive on exploring the possibilities and challenges it presents. I enjoy delving deep into digital design concepts and leveraging HDLs to craft efficient and optimized RTL architectures.

With a focus on continual learning, I am committed to expanding my knowledge in areas such as FPGA development, synthesis, and verification. I actively seek opportunities to enhance my skills and stay abreast of the latest advancements in the industry.

This GitHub repository serves as a platform for me to showcase my RTL projects and document my educational journey. I aim to share my experiences, exchange ideas, and collaborate with fellow enthusiasts in the VLSI community.

Join me on this exciting adventure in digital design and RTL coding, as I harness Xilinx Vivado and my passion for VLSI to create innovative solutions!

### Contents of the Repository

This repository contains a compilation of my foundational RTL codes, such as:

Basic gates 

Adders,subtractor circuits

Multipliers

Comparators

Multiplexers (Muxes)

Encoders,Decoders

Counters 

Sequence detectors

Shift registers

Arithmetic logic units (ALUs)

Finite state machines (FSMs)

And additional!

Each project features the RTL code, simulation files, and accompanying documentation, providing you with insights into the implementation details.

These projects serve as excellent entry points for grasping RTL coding concepts and developing a solid understanding of digital design fundamentals.

Below is the list of RTL codes organized by day:

Day-1: All basic,universal,derived gates!

Day-2: Gates implementation using universal gates!

Day-3: FA using HA!

#### Tools and Technologies

I primarily work with Xilinx Vivado and ModelSim for RTL simulation. Vivado delivers a robust platform for designing, implementing, and troubleshooting FPGA-based digital systems. Meanwhile, ModelSim provides a thorough simulation environment for evaluating and validating the functionality of my RTL designs.

##### Contributions and Feedback

I encourage contributions, suggestions, and feedback on my projects. If you come across something intriguing or have ideas to improve my RTL designs, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Letâ€™s collaborate and grow together!
