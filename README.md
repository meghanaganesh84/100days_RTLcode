# Welcome to My 100_DaysOfRTL!

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Meghana Ganesh, and I have a strong passion for digital design and RTL programming. This repository is focused on my 100-day RTL challenge, where I'll be documenting my journey and sharing RTL design projects using tools like Xilinx Vivado and ModelSim for simulations.

## About me...

I'm a passionate engineer and a VLSI aficionado with a keen interest in digital circuitry and hardware description languages (HDLs). As a learner, I have acquired hands-on experience in RTL programming using Verilog and have extensively utilized Xilinx Vivado.

My enthusiasm lies in the realm of VLSI design, and I thrive on exploring the possibilities and challenges it presents. I enjoy delving deep into digital design concepts and leveraging HDLs to craft efficient and optimized RTL architectures.

With a focus on continual learning, I am committed to expanding my knowledge in areas such as FPGA development, synthesis, and verification. I actively seek opportunities to enhance my skills and stay abreast of the latest advancements in the industry.

This GitHub repository serves as a platform for me to showcase my RTL projects and document my educational journey. I aim to share my experiences, exchange ideas, and collaborate with fellow enthusiasts in the VLSI community.

Join me on this exciting adventure in digital design and RTL coding, as I harness Xilinx Vivado and my passion for VLSI to create innovative solutions!
